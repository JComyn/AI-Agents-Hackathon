# Housing finder chatbot

## Description
This repository contains the solution for a chatbot designed to help users find their ideal apartments based on housing data. The chatbot utilizes vector databases with embeddings to store housing information and leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo to assist users in making queries and finding the perfect accommodation.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Housing data including various attributes such as location, price, size... are collected and stored in the vector database.
2. **Embedding Generation**: The housing data is transformed into embeddings, allowing efficient storage and similarity calculations.
3. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the chatbot through a user-friendly interface, expressing their preferences and requirements for an apartment.
4. **Query Processing**: The chatbot processes user queries using natural language understanding capabilities, extracting key information and intent.
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Based on the user's preferences and available housing data, the chatbot generates personalized recommendations.
